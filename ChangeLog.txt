1. Migrated code to SpringBoot 2.4.4
2. Cleaned up CakeEntity class for naming consistency and constraints
3. Used RestTemplate to fetch initial data
4. Added basic tests for Controller
5. Unfortunately didn't have time for the rest (dockerize via SpringBoot, OAuth and CI/CD) due to lack of setup
6. Use Postman/Browser to test or Curl 

		curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8282/'
		
		curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8282/cakes' \
				--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
				--data-raw '{"title":"1","desc":"2","image":"3"}'
